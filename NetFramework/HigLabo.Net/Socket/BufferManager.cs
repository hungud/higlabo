	/// A manager to handle buffers for the socket connections
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// When used in an async call a buffer is pinned. Large numbers of pinned buffers
	/// cause problem with the GC (in particular it causes heap fragmentation).
	///
	/// This class maintains a set of large segments and gives clients pieces of these
	/// segments that they can use for their buffers. The alternative to this would be to
    /// create many small arrays which it then maintains. This methodology should be slightly
	/// better than the many small array methodology because in creating only a few very
	/// large Objects it will force these Objects to be placed on the LOH. Since the
	/// Objects are on the LOH they are at this time not subject to compacting which would
	/// require an update of all GC roots as would be the case with lots of smaller arrays
	/// that were in the normal heap.
